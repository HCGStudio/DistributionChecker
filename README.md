# DistributionChecker
A small library that helps you check your running distribution.

[Demo](https://github.com/HCGStudio/DistributionChecker/blob/main/demo/DistributionCheckerDemo/Program.cs)

Usage :
``` CSharp
var distribution = new DistributionChecker().GetDistribution();
```
And you will get all the information you need.

We also have some Extenstion methods such as:
``` CSharp
distribution.IsUbuntu();
distribution.IsLikeRedHat();
distribution.IsOrLikeArchLinux();
//...
//Of course there are some more!
```
These methods work just like their names. 

## How it works

It reads your /etc/os-release and parase with NFA.
Information about os-release was found at https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html and many XML documents are from it.
